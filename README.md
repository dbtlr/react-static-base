# React-Static - Custom Site Base

This is a [React Static](https://react-static.js.org/) base site that is designed to use a set of my own sensible defaults.

This includes:

- Removing the automatic blog
- Adding [FontAwesome 5](https://fontawesome.com)
- Adding Google font support for Open Sans
- Adding a sensible base stylesheet/normalizer
- Adding a responsive header / menu
- A basic Layout component

You can see it live here: https://react-static-base.dbtlr.com

## Installation

First, follow the instruction for installing the React Static command line tool.

Next, run the following command:

```
react-static create --template=https://github.com/dbtlr/react-static-base
```

You will be asked to name your application and it will be created in your current directory.

## Motivation

I love [React Static](https://react-static.js.org/). In fact, I love it so much that I keep going back to it every time I launch a new site, project, or plaything. It has easily replace Create React App. The only thing is, I find myself spending the first 1-2 hours doing the same modifications and usually copying some basics from my other projects.

Perhaps this structure isn't for you.

## Special Thanks

I want to thank the team at [Nozzle](https://nozzle.io), especially [Tanner Linsley](https://github.com/tannerlinsley) for creating React Static. It has absolutely changed how I think about starting new React projects.
